### Project Description

We are making a website where users can place prescription order pickups. After placement, runners can pick up the order and deliver it with their progress tracked using Google Maps API.

#### Mission: 

To allow patients/users to receive medication from pharmacies without leaving their location while monitoring the delivery progress in real time. Also to enlist drivers to deliver said medication to patients/users for compensation.
