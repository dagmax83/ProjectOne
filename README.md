### Project Description

We are making a website where users can place prescription order pickups. After placement, runners can pick up the order and deliver it with their progress tracked using Google Maps API.

#### Mission: 

To allow patients/users to recieve medication from pharmacies without leaving their location while monitoring the delivery progress in real time. Also to enlist drivers to deliver said medication to patients/users for compensation. 

### Sketch of Final Product

### APIs to Be Used
- Google Maps API: to generate delivery time and possibly driver location status with map visual.
- Slack API: for messaging (user to drive and vice/versa)
- API for transactional purposes: TBA
